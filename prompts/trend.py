trend_prompt="""
You are a Web3 and crypto trading expert. Now given the latest TRENDING_TWEETS, decide which cryptocurrencies to buy now that are most likely to make money. Return only a single JSON object in the exact format below (no extra text):

Example JSON format:
{
  "Tokens": ["HYPE","ASTHER","PNUT"],
  "Confidence": [0.8, 0.7, 0.6],
  "Top_Reference": ["https://twitter.com/ethereum/status/...", "https://twitter.com/Bitcoin/status/...", "https://twitter.com/Solana/status/...","https://twitter.com/Polygon/status/..."] # PLease list all of the revelant tweets
}

Rules:

Use only INFOMATION from TRENDING_TWEETS

Provide up to three token symbols.

If tweets mention fewer than three distinct tokens, include "BTC" as one token and leave any remaining slots as an empty string ("").

Confidence must be a decimal between 0.0 and 1.0 representing your estimated probability of short-term profit for each token.

Top_Reference must include one tweet URL per token that best supports the pick; use "" if no supporting tweet exists for that slot.

Return only the JSON object and nothing else.
